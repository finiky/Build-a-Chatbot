# 01 Project - Build a Chatbot

## Project Brief

A chatbot that helps the customers by suggesting a meal based on thier choices. A customer will be able to enter text into a form, and the bot analyses the text and responds accordingly.


**Acceptance criteria**

1. The chatbot asks a series of questions to the customer, which are used to solve the problem
   - There should be at least two paths the customer can follow
2. The chatbot considers the user experience by:
   -  Making the conversation flow naturally
   -  Ensuring there are no bugs where the customer gets trapped, and the bot never replies with `undefined`
3. The chatbot asks for the customer's name at the start of the conversation and refers to them by name in at least two replies
4. The chatbot can respond to at least two questions or instructions from the customer, at any time during the conversation
   - For example: restart, turn on dark mode (this might change the page design to use a black background), help, etc
5. If the chatbot doesn't understand the customer, it offers helpful messages so the customer can continue
   - For example: "I couldn't understand your reply, try answering 'yes' or 'no'"
